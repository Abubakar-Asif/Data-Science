# Statistics Notes & Learning (Data Science Journey)

## Overview
This repository contains my **Statistics learning notes** in both **PDF** and **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** format.  
I created this project while learning **Data Science**, and it covers the essential topics that form the foundation of statistical understanding — from data types and measurement scales to sampling, errors, and probability concepts.

> This content represents what I have learned so far in my Data Science journey, and I’ll continue to **update and expand** it over time.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Statistics  
- Pillars of Data (Research, Collection, Analysis, Interpretation, etc.)  
- Data Types (Qualitative, Quantitative)  
- Levels/Scales of Measurement (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)  
- Data Collection & Sampling Techniques  
- Data Encoding & Data Categories  
- Structured, Unstructured, Semi-Structured, and Boolean Data  
- Measurement & Operationalization

## Purpose
I am currently learning **Data Science**, and this repository is part of my personal study path.  
By sharing these notes, I aim to :
- Strengthen my understanding through documentation  
- Help other beginners in their Data Science journey  
- Keep track of my learning progress publicly on GitHub

## Tech Stack
- Python (for .ipynb notebook)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Markdown / LaTeX for documentation  
- GitHub for sharing and version control  

---

## Future Updates
This repository will be updated soon with:
- Clean and formatted Jupyter Notebook version (.ipynb)  
- Practical examples and Python code snippets for each topic  
- Visualization demos using Matplotlib and Seaborn
