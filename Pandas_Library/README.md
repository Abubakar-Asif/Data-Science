# Pandas Practice Notebooks for Data Science

This repository contains my personal practice notebooks focused on learning the Pandas library for data analysis. As a beginner in data science, I’m using these files to build a strong foundation in working with structured data, exploring datasets, and applying core Python techniques.

---

## Purpose

I am actively learning data science and documenting my progress through hands-on practice. These notebooks are not final projects—they are part of my learning journey. My goal is to become a professional data scientist, and this repository reflects the early steps I’m taking to get there.

## What These Notebooks Cover

Each notebook explores different aspects of the Pandas library:

- Understanding data types and DataFrames
- Importing and exporting data (Excel, CSV)
- Cleaning and preprocessing datasets
- Sorting, filtering, and indexing data
- Grouping and aggregating values
- Handling missing data
- Working with built-in datasets like Titanic, Iris, and Tips
- Sampling and slicing data
- Boolean indexing and conditional selection
- Basic data visualization using Seaborn

## Datasets Used

- Titanic dataset (`sns.load_dataset("titanic")`)
- Iris dataset (`sns.load_dataset("iris")`)
- Tips dataset (`sns.load_dataset("tips")`)
- Custom Excel files created for practice

---

## Learning Goals

- Build confidence in using Pandas and NumPy
- Understand how to explore and clean real-world datasets
- Practice writing readable, structured Python code
- Prepare for more advanced topics like machine learning and model building
- Create a portfolio that reflects my growth and understanding

---

## Status

These notebooks are part of my active learning process. I will continue updating this repository as I learn new techniques and apply them to more complex problems.
